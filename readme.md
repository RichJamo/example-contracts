## Overview

Welcome to the ZetaChain example contracts repository! This collection of smart
contract projects is written using Hardhat and Solidity, specifically for the
ZetaChain blockchain. Each project showcases different functionalities and use
cases that can be implemented on the ZetaChain platform.

These example contracts cover various aspects of ZetaChain development,
including token contracts, smart contract testing, and deploying contracts to a
ZetaChain network.

Our goal is to provide helpful resources to get you started with building dApps
on the ZetaChain blockchain. If you have any questions or feedback, please feel
free to open an issue or submit a pull request. Happy coding!

## Tutorials

If you are new to ZetaChain and would like to learn how to use these example
contracts, check out
[the tutorial section in our documentation](https://www.zetachain.com/docs/developers/overview/).
The tutorials provide step-by-step instructions on setting up your development
environment, deploying contracts, and interacting with the ZetaChain network.
